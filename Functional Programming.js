/*
Functional programming is a style of programming where solutions are simple, isolated functions, without any side effects outside of the 
function scope.

INPUT -> PROCESS -> OUTPUT

Functional programming is about:

1) Isolated functions - there is no dependence on the state of the program, which includes global letiables that are subject to change

2) Pure functions - the same input always gives the same output.

3) Functions with limited side effects - any changes, or mutations, to the state of the program outside the function are carefully 
controlled.

Two distinct principles for functional programming:

1) Don't alter a letiable or object - create new letiables and objects and return them if need be from a function.

2) Declare function arguments - any computation inside a function depends only on the arguments, and not on any global object or letiable.

Adding one to a number is not very exciting, but we can apply these principles when working with arrays or more complex objects.

/*Calling the getTea function to get x cups of tea for the team, and store them in the tea4TeamFCC letiable.
The getTea() function takes in one letiable - numOfCups. A teaCups[] array is first made and a for loop is set up to count the number 
of cups passed into the function. A new cup of tea is then pushed to the array through every iteration of the for loop.

Thus resulting in an array full of the amount of teacups originally passed into the getTea() function.
 */

/*
Callbacks are the functions that are slipped or passed into another function to decide the invocation of that function. 
For example in filter, the callback function tells JavaScript the criteria for how to filter an array.

Functions that can be assigned to a letiable, passed into another function, or returned from another function just like any other 
normal value, are called first class functions. In JavaScript, all functions are first class functions.

The functions that take a function as an argument, or return a function as a return value are called higher order functions.

When the functions are passed in to another function or returned from another function, then those functions which gets passed in or 
returned can be called a lambda.

/*
Using object-oriented code to model browsing the web in your browser and tracking the tabs user has opened. 

A Window object is made up of tabs, and you usually have more than one Window open. The titles of each open site in each Window object is 
held in an array. After working in the browser (opening new tabs, merging windows, and closing tabs), you want to print the tabs that are 
still open. Closed tabs are removed from the array and new tabs (for simplicity) get added to the end of it.

The code editor shows an implementation of this functionality with functions for tabOpen(), tabClose(), and join(). The array tabs is 
part of the Window object that stores the name of the open pages.

This is an example of how mutation can cause unexpected results. If the splice method was used in the tabClose() function, 
splice will change the original array it is called on, and the second call to it will use a modified array, and gave unexpected results.
*/

/*
In functional programming, changing or altering things is called mutation, and the outcome is called a side effect. A function, ideally, 
should be a pure function, meaning that it does not cause any side effects.

Its easy to mistakenly alter a letiable or object. Example below shows how to alter a letiable/object.  
*/ 

//function incrementer returns the value of the global letiable fixedValue increased by one.
let fixedValue = 4
function incrementer () {
  //return fixedValue ++ //using the ++ operator will mutate fixedValue; meaning it will no longer reference original value assigned
  return fixedValue +1
}
let newValue = incrementer() // Should equal 5
console.log(fixedValue) // Should print 4
console.log(newValue)

/*
Another principle of functional programming is to always declare your dependencies explicitly. This means if a function depends on a 
letiable or object being present, then pass that letiable or object directly into the function as an argument.

There are several good consequences from this principle. The function is easier to test, you know exactly what input it takes, and it 
won't depend on anything else in your program.

This can give you more confidence when you alter, remove, or add new code. You would know what you can or cannot change and you can 
see where the potential traps are.

Finally, the function would always produce the same output for the same set of inputs, no matter what part of the code executes it. 

Code will provide the same result as function incrementer ().  This time passing the fixedValue2 into the function as a parameter.
In previous example, function incrementer () was dependent on letiable fixedValue.  However, the letiable was not passed directly to
function.

/*
The map method iterates over each item in an array and returns a new array containing the results of calling the callback function on 
each element. It does this without mutating the original array.

When the callback is used, it is passed three arguments. The first argument is the current element being processed. The second is the 
index of that element and the third is the array upon which the map method was called.

map method returns an array of the same length as the one it was called on. It also doesn't alter the original array, as long as its 
callback function doesn't.

map is a pure function, and its output depends solely on its inputs. Plus, it takes another function as its argument.

  { name: 'John', age: 34 },
